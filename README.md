The objective of the project was to produce a high quality, 3D printed, quadrupedal robot capable of traversing even, uneven and slopped terrain and with comparable dexterity (for its size) as a the Boston Dynamics Spot Mini robot but with a low cost and easy to source parts list and ROS compatibility. 
<br>



This robot was inspired by the <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/diy-quadruped-robot-1">Kangal </a>, <a href="https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SpotMicro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adham-elarabawy/open-quadruped">Open Quadruped</a>. The concept was to have the best parts of all designs and make it compatible with <a href="https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SpotMicro</a> parts.
The current cost of the robot is around Â£250
